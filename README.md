I always wondered how [Internet Download Manager](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/) downloads files faster and  
how it integrates itself to capture videos on YouTube and other sites to provide a download button for downloading them.  
But they have a paid plan after thirty days, and having a monopoly on the same, most people resort to cracking it (which is unsafe)  
or paying. I have initiated a project to create a powerful download agent like it or even more powerful, which is open-source.
